* This program defines a banking system. It will help banks to become fully computerized which will smoothen their working and increase their efficiency and business. It will implement the various banking functions like checking account, withdrawing and depositing amount from one's account, creating and removing accounts etc.
* Online Banking system enables bank users to access their accounts and general information about bankâ€™s products and services from the comfort of your PC. This application aims at secure banking system which will be accessible to any authenticated user with valid user id and password.
